#  simple RESTful web service in Kotlin for Android Notes App 

This is a very simple project using kotlin framework KTor.
This Notes API allows android app to perform basic CRUD operations (immutable database) with JSON as data exchange format.

I intend to enhance this project as I learn more about Kotlin and KTor
and connected my own Notes App with this REST API where i can sync my notes to server in realtime.

This Notes Api uses Postgres database by default but you can change to other by passing DB_TYPE=postgres environment variable. 
The connection settings can also be passed via environment variables (please check application.conf).

The complete front-end android app will be updated soon.
